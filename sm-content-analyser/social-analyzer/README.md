## Social Media Content Analyzer

The **Social Media Content Analyzer** is a powerful web application built with **React** that helps users refine and optimize their content before sharing it on social platforms. Its goal is to simplify content evaluation while providing meaningful insights to improve audience engagement.

The app uses **Clerk** for secure and seamless authentication, ensuring a safe and personalized user experience. Content can be uploaded effortlessly through a **drag-and-drop interface** or standard file selection, making it both flexible and user-friendly.

It supports a variety of file formats. For **images**, it employs **Tesseract.js (OCR)** to detect and extract embedded text. For **PDF files**, it automatically parses and retrieves textual data, enabling smooth analysis regardless of format.

Once the text is obtained, the application runs **sentiment analysis** to determine tone (positive, negative, or neutral) and generates **custom recommendations** to boost clarity, impact, and engagementâ€”tailored to social media standards.

By combining OCR, PDF parsing, sentiment insights, and actionable suggestions, this tool equips creators with everything they need to craft compelling posts that stand out and connect effectively with their audience.
